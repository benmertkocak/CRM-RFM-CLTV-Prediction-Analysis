# CRM-RFM-CLTV-Prediction-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer value for a retail business through advanced statistical models. By leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, BG-NBD (Beta-Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution), and the Gamma-Gamma model, we aim to understand and predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).
